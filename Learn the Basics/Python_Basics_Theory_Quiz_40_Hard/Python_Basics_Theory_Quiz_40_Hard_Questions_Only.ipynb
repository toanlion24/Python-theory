    "## Question 1: Default Argument Evaluation\n\n**Theory:** Python evaluates default arguments only once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called. For mutable objects like lists or dictionaries, this creates a shared object across all function calls.\n\nWhy does this behavior occur, and what is the fundamental reason Python was designed this way?\n\nA) Python is trying to optimize memory usage by reusing objects, and default arguments are treated as class variables that persist across calls\n\nB) Default arguments are evaluated during function definition, not during function call, which is more efficient but creates shared mutable state when mutable objects are used\n\nC) Python treats default arguments as global variables that are created once when the module is loaded, making them accessible to all function instances\n\nD) This is a bug in Python's implementation that should be fixed; default arguments should be evaluated fresh each time to prevent this unexpected behavior\n\nE) Default arguments are stored as constants in the function's bytecode, and Python reuses constant objects to save memory, which only affects immutable types\n\n\n---\n"

    "## Question 2: Mutable vs Immutable Types\n\n**Theory:** In Python, some types are mutable (can be changed in-place) while others are immutable (cannot be changed once created). Understanding this distinction is crucial for understanding Python's behavior.\n\nWhich statement accurately describes Python's memory management for mutable vs immutable objects?\n\nA) Immutable objects are always stored on the stack, while mutable objects are stored on the heap, which explains why strings cannot be modified but lists can\n\nB) All objects in Python are actually mutable; the difference is that \"immutable\" types have methods that return new objects instead of modifying in-place, creating an illusion of immutability\n\nC) Immutable objects can be cached and reused (interning), and their identity can be shared, while mutable objects must have unique identities to prevent unintended sharing of modified state\n\nD) Python uses copy-on-write for immutable objects, meaning they appear immutable but are actually modified internally; only when you explicitly create a new object does Python allocate new memory\n\nE) The mutable/immutable distinction is purely a convention for developers; Python treats all objects the same internally, and the distinction only affects which methods are available\n\n\n---\n"

    "## Question 3: String Interning\n\n**Theory:** Python may intern certain strings, storing them in a special internal cache and reusing the same object for multiple string literals with the same value.\n\nUnder what conditions does Python reliably intern strings, and why might two strings with identical content not have the same identity?\n\nA) Python interns all strings automatically to save memory, but only for strings shorter than 20 characters; longer strings are never interned regardless of how they're created\n\nB) Python automatically interns all string literals in source code during compilation, but strings created dynamically at runtime (like through concatenation or input) are not interned, even if they match an interned literal\n\nC) String interning only occurs for strings that appear more than 3 times in the same module; this optimization was added in Python 3.8 to reduce memory for frequently used strings\n\nD) All strings in Python are interned if they contain only ASCII characters; non-ASCII characters prevent interning due to encoding complexities, which is why Unicode strings use more memory\n\nE) String interning is never guaranteed in Python; it's an implementation detail that varies between Python versions and should never be relied upon, making `is` comparisons unreliable for strings\n\n\n---\n"

    "## Question 4: List vs Tuple Performance\n\n**Theory:** Lists and tuples are both sequence types in Python, but lists are mutable while tuples are immutable. This difference affects both functionality and performance.\n\nIn terms of memory usage and performance, which statement is most accurate about when to use tuples vs lists?\n\nA) Tuples use significantly less memory than lists because they are stored as fixed-size arrays, while lists require extra space for growth; tuples should always be preferred for read-only sequences\n\nB) The memory difference between tuples and lists is minimal; tuples are slightly faster for iteration but lists are faster for random access, so the choice should be based on mutability needs rather than performance\n\nC) Lists are more memory-efficient than tuples because they use dynamic allocation, while tuples allocate fixed-size blocks that may waste space; lists should be preferred unless immutability is required\n\nD) Tuples consume exactly half the memory of lists because they don't store metadata about mutability; this makes tuples the preferred choice for large collections of homogeneous data\n\nE) The memory overhead is identical; tuples are just lists with a flag set to prevent modification, so there's no performance benefit to using tuples over lists\n\n\n---\n"

    "## Question 5: Dictionary Key Requirements\n\n**Theory:** Dictionary keys must be hashable, which means they must be immutable types that implement both __hash__() and __eq__() methods consistently.\n\nWhy must dictionary keys be hashable, and what would happen if mutable types like lists were allowed as keys?\n\nA) Hashable keys are required for the dictionary's hash table implementation; if lists were keys, changing a list after it's used as a key would break the hash table's lookup mechanism because the hash value would change but the key in the table wouldn't be updated\n\nB) Dictionary keys don't actually need to be hashable; this restriction exists only to prevent beginner mistakes, and in future Python versions, all types will be allowed as keys\n\nC) The hashable requirement is for security reasons; allowing mutable keys would create vulnerabilities where attackers could modify keys to access unauthorized dictionary entries\n\nD) Hashable keys enable faster lookups using hash codes; mutable keys are allowed in some programming languages, but Python's restriction is arbitrary and could be removed without issues\n\nE) Keys must be hashable so dictionaries can be serialized to JSON; if lists were keys, JSON serialization would fail because JSON objects require string keys\n\n\n---\n"

    "## Question 6: Scope Resolution (LEGB Rule)\n\n**Theory:** Python follows the LEGB rule for name resolution: Local, Enclosing (nonlocal), Global, and Built-in scopes are searched in that order.\n\nWhat happens when you assign a value to a variable inside a function if a variable with the same name exists in the global scope?\n\nA) The assignment automatically modifies the global variable; Python always searches global scope first when assigning, so no special keyword is needed to modify globals\n\nB) The assignment creates a new local variable that shadows the global variable; to modify the global variable, you must use the `global` keyword before the assignment\n\nC) Python raises a SyntaxError because you cannot have local and global variables with the same name; you must rename one to avoid the conflict\n\nD) The assignment modifies the global variable if it's mutable (like a list), but creates a local variable if it's immutable (like a string); this behavior depends on the type\n\nE) Python uses the value from the nearest scope (local first), but assignment always modifies the global scope regardless of where the assignment occurs\n\n\n---\n"

    "## Question 7: Exception Handling and Finally Block\n\n**Theory:** The `finally` block in Python always executes, whether an exception occurs or not, and even if there's a return statement in the try or except block.\n\nWhat is the order of execution when a `finally` block contains a return statement, and how does it interact with return statements in try/except blocks?\n\nA) The finally block executes after try/except, and if finally has a return statement, it completely overrides any return value from try/except blocks, making the earlier return value inaccessible\n\nB) The finally block executes, but any return statement in finally is ignored; only the return from try/except blocks matters, and finally just executes cleanup code without affecting return values\n\nC) If finally has a return, it executes first before try/except returns, allowing finally to modify the return value by passing it through additional processing before the function actually returns\n\nD) Finally blocks with return statements are illegal in Python and raise a SyntaxError; the finally block can only contain cleanup code, not control flow statements like return\n\nE) The order depends on the Python version: Python 2 executes finally after return, while Python 3 changed this to execute finally before return, preserving both return values\n\n\n---\n"

    "## Question 8: Generator Expressions vs List Comprehensions\n\n**Theory:** Generator expressions use parentheses and create iterator objects that yield values on-demand, while list comprehensions create complete lists in memory immediately.\n\nWhat are the key memory and performance differences between generator expressions and list comprehensions?\n\nA) Generator expressions use exactly the same amount of memory as list comprehensions because both are evaluated lazily in Python 3; the only difference is syntax preference\n\nB) List comprehensions are faster for small datasets but generators are faster for large datasets; however, both consume the same memory, with generators just deferring allocation\n\nC) Generator expressions are memory-efficient because they produce values one at a time on-demand, while list comprehensions create the entire list in memory immediately; generators are iterators that don't store all values\n\nD) Generators consume more memory because they must store the entire computation state, while list comprehensions just store values; lists are more efficient for memory but slower to create\n\nE) The difference is purely conceptual; Python's interpreter converts generator expressions to list comprehensions internally, so there's no actual performance or memory difference\n\n\n---\n"

    "## Question 9: Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy\n\n**Theory:** Shallow copy creates a new object but doesn't recursively copy nested objects, so nested mutable objects are still shared. Deep copy recursively copies all nested objects.\n\nWhen does a shallow copy behave differently from a deep copy, and what is the underlying mechanism that causes this difference?\n\nA) Shallow and deep copies always behave identically; the distinction is only relevant in other programming languages, and Python's copy module treats them the same way\n\nB) Shallow copies only differ from deep copies for tuples containing lists; for all other data structures, both copy types produce identical results because Python optimizes copying\n\nC) Shallow copy creates a new container object but references to nested objects point to the same memory locations; deep copy recursively creates new objects for all nested structures, preventing shared references\n\nD) Shallow copy is faster but only works for flat structures; deep copy is slower but required for nested structures; Python automatically chooses the appropriate method based on data structure depth\n\nE) The difference is in how immutable types are handled: shallow copy reuses immutable nested objects (saving memory), while deep copy unnecessarily duplicates immutable objects, wasting memory\n\n\n---\n"

    "## Question 10: Set Uniqueness and Hashing\n\n**Theory:** Sets in Python automatically maintain uniqueness by using hash values to quickly identify and prevent duplicate elements.\n\nHow does Python ensure set elements are unique, and what happens when you try to add a duplicate element?\n\nA) Sets maintain a sorted list internally and check for duplicates by comparing each new element with all existing elements; adding duplicates raises a ValueError\n\nB) Sets use hash values for quick lookup; when adding an element, Python computes its hash, checks if that hash exists, and if the element equals an existing element with the same hash, it silently ignores the duplicate\n\nC) Sets check for duplicates using the `==` operator against all existing elements in order; this O(n) check makes sets slow for large collections but ensures perfect uniqueness\n\nD) Uniqueness is enforced by converting all elements to strings and comparing their string representations; this means [1,2] and \"[1,2]\" would be considered duplicates\n\nE) Sets don't actually enforce uniqueness; duplicates are stored but filtered during iteration, which is why len(set) may not equal the number of elements added\n\n\n---\n"

    "## Question 11: List Comprehension vs Loop Performance\n\n**Theory:** List comprehensions are generally faster than equivalent for loops for creating lists, but the reasons for this performance difference are often misunderstood.\n\nWhy are list comprehensions typically faster than equivalent for loops for creating lists?\n\nA) List comprehensions are compiled to optimized bytecode that avoids the overhead of the loop variable and append method calls, executing operations more efficiently in the Python virtual machine\n\nB) List comprehensions are faster because they use C extensions under the hood, while for loops execute entirely in Python bytecode, making comprehensions nearly as fast as C code\n\nC) The performance difference is a myth; list comprehensions are actually slower because they create a temporary list internally before returning, while loops can modify lists in-place more efficiently\n\nD) List comprehensions automatically parallelize across multiple CPU cores, while loops run sequentially; this parallelization provides the speed advantage for large datasets\n\nE) The speed comes from list comprehensions being interpreted as generator expressions first, then converted to lists; this two-step process is more optimized than single-step loops\n\n\n---\n"

    "## Question 12: Type Coercion in Operations\n\n**Theory:** Python automatically converts between compatible numeric types during operations (like int + float), but this behavior has specific rules.\n\nHow does Python handle type coercion when performing operations between different numeric types?\n\nA) Python never converts types automatically; operations between different types always raise TypeError; you must explicitly convert types using int(), float(), or str() before operations\n\nB) Python follows a hierarchy: complex > float > int; when mixing types, Python automatically converts to the \"higher\" type in this hierarchy to preserve precision and avoid information loss\n\nC) Type coercion depends on the operation: addition converts to float, multiplication converts to int, and division always produces float regardless of input types\n\nD) Python uses the type of the first operand; if the first operand is int, the result is int; if it's float, the result is float; types are never mixed in calculations\n\nE) All numeric operations return strings to ensure type safety; numbers are converted to strings before operations, then parsed back, which prevents type-related errors\n\n\n---\n"

    "## Question 13: String Slicing Behavior\n\n**Theory:** String slicing in Python uses indices and creates new string objects; understanding how negative indices and step values work is crucial.\n\nWhat happens when you slice a string with a step value of -1, and how does Python handle the start and stop indices in this case?\n\nA) A step of -1 reverses the string, but only if start is 0 and stop is omitted; if start and stop are specified, Python raises ValueError because negative steps require special handling\n\nB) A step of -1 reverses the string; start and stop still work normally but are interpreted relative to the original string (not the reversed one), so [::-1] reverses the entire string\n\nC) Negative step values are not supported for strings; only lists can be sliced with negative steps; strings require using reversed() function instead\n\nD) When step is -1, start must be greater than stop for the slice to work; Python automatically swaps them if start < stop, which is why [::-1] works for reversing\n\nE) Negative steps only work with lists, not strings; string slicing with step=-1 creates a list of characters, not a reversed string, requiring join() to reconstruct the string\n\n\n---\n"

    "## Question 26: Iterator Protocol\n\n**Theory:** Iterators are objects that implement __iter__() and __next__() methods, allowing iteration over collections.\n\nWhat is the iterator protocol, and how do for loops use iterators internally?\n\nA) Iterators don't exist in Python; for loops directly access list indices and use indexing to iterate, which is why loops only work with sequences that support indexing\n\nB) The iterator protocol requires __iter__() to return self and __next__() to return the next value or raise StopIteration; for loops automatically call these methods, converting iterables to iterators\n\nC) Iterators are only used for generator functions; regular for loops use a different mechanism called 'sequence protocol' that requires __getitem__() and __len__() methods\n\nD) The iterator protocol was removed in Python 3; modern for loops use a new 'iterable protocol' that only requires objects to be subscriptable (support indexing with []), not true iterators\n\nE) Iterators must implement __has_next__() and __get_next__() methods; __iter__() and __next__() are legacy Python 2 methods that are deprecated but still supported for compatibility\n\n\n---\n"

    "## Question 27: List Slicing Behavior\n\n**Theory:** List slicing creates new list objects; understanding how indices work with slicing is important for avoiding common mistakes.\n\nWhat happens when you assign to a list slice, and how does it differ from assigning to an index?\n\nA) Assigning to a slice replaces the slice with a single value, reducing the list length; assigning to an index replaces one element, keeping the length the same\n\nB) Slice assignment replaces the specified slice with the elements from the right-hand side, which can change the list length; index assignment replaces one element at that position\n\nC) Slice and index assignment are identical; both replace elements, and Python automatically converts slice assignment to index assignment internally\n\nD) Slice assignment doesn't work in Python; you can only assign to individual indices, and attempting slice assignment raises TypeError\n\nE) Assigning to a slice creates a new list and reassigns the variable, while index assignment modifies in-place; slices always create copies, never modify originals\n\n\n---\n"

    "## Question 28: Type Checking vs Duck Typing\n\n**Theory:** Python uses duck typing (behavior-based typing) rather than strict type checking; 'if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck.'\n\nWhat is duck typing, and why does Python prefer it over explicit type checking?\n\nA) Duck typing means Python automatically converts types to match what's expected; if a function expects a string but gets an int, Python converts it automatically\n\nB) Duck typing means code works with any object that has the required methods/attributes, regardless of its actual type; this promotes flexibility and polymorphism without inheritance requirements\n\nC) Duck typing is a type system that requires all objects to explicitly declare what 'duck interface' they implement; it's stricter than regular typing because it enforces interface contracts\n\nD) Duck typing was removed in Python 3.5 with the introduction of type hints; modern Python requires explicit type declarations, making duck typing obsolete\n\nE) Duck typing means Python checks types at runtime and raises TypeError if types don't match; it's called 'duck' typing because it's as strict as a duck's quacking requirements\n\n\n---\n"

    "## Question 29: Dictionary Ordering (Python 3.7+)\n\n**Theory:** As of Python 3.7, dictionaries maintain insertion order as part of the language specification (it was implementation detail in 3.6).\n\nWhat does it mean that dictionaries maintain insertion order, and what are the implications?\n\nA) Dictionaries are automatically sorted by key values; when you iterate or print a dict, keys appear in sorted order regardless of insertion order\n\nB) Dictionaries preserve the order in which key-value pairs were added; iterating over a dictionary will return items in the same order they were inserted, which is guaranteed in Python 3.7+\n\nC) Insertion order only matters for display purposes; dict.keys(), .values(), and .items() return ordered results, but dictionary lookups still use hash-based ordering internally\n\nD) Order preservation is optional; dictionaries have an 'ordered=True' parameter when creating them, and if not specified, they revert to random ordering like Python 2\n\nE) This feature only works for string keys; dictionaries with non-string keys don't maintain order because hashing for non-strings produces unpredictable ordering\n\n\n---\n"

    "## Question 30: Lambda Functions Limitations\n\n**Theory:** Lambda functions are anonymous functions that can only contain expressions, not statements.\n\nWhat are the limitations of lambda functions compared to regular functions?\n\nA) Lambda functions are identical to regular functions; the 'lambda' keyword is just syntactic sugar, and there are no functional differences or limitations\n\nB) Lambdas can only contain a single expression (no statements like if/else blocks, loops, or assignments), cannot have docstrings or annotations, and are limited in complexity\n\nC) The only limitation is that lambdas cannot have default arguments; everything else (loops, conditionals, assignments) works identically to regular functions\n\nD) Lambda functions are slower than regular functions because they're interpreted rather than compiled; this is the main limitation, but syntax is identical\n\nE) Lambdas can only be used as function arguments (like in map/filter); they cannot be assigned to variables or used as standalone functions, which is their primary limitation\n\n\n---\n"

    "## Question 34: Dynamic Typing vs Static Typing\n\n**Theory:** Python is dynamically typed: variable types are determined at runtime, not declared in code.\n\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of Python's dynamic typing compared to static typing?\n\nA) Dynamic typing has no advantages; it's inherently worse than static typing because type errors are caught at runtime instead of compile time, making programs less reliable\n\nB) Dynamic typing provides flexibility and less boilerplate but catches type errors at runtime; static typing catches errors earlier but requires more explicit type declarations\n\nC) There's no difference; Python 3.5+ requires static type declarations using type hints, making Python statically typed, so the question is based on outdated information about Python 2\n\nD) Dynamic typing is faster because the interpreter doesn't need to check types; static typing languages are slower due to compile-time type checking overhead\n\nE) Dynamic typing means types can change during execution (a variable can be int then str); static typing prevents this, but Python allows both, so the distinction is meaningless\n\n\n---\n"

    "## Question 36: Garbage Collection\n\n**Theory:** Python uses automatic garbage collection to reclaim memory from objects that are no longer referenced.\n\nHow does Python's garbage collector work, and when are objects deleted from memory?\n\nA) Python immediately deletes objects when they go out of scope; garbage collection happens synchronously, ensuring memory is freed as soon as variables are no longer accessible\n\nB) Python uses reference counting (immediate cleanup when count reaches 0) plus a cyclic garbage collector (handles circular references); objects are deleted when no longer referenced and GC runs\n\nC) Python doesn't have garbage collection; memory is managed manually using del statements, and objects persist until explicitly deleted, which is why Python programs can have memory leaks\n\nD) Garbage collection only runs when explicitly called with gc.collect(); Python never automatically frees memory, requiring developers to manually trigger cleanup when needed\n\nE) Python's GC works like Java: it runs periodically in a separate thread and deletes objects it hasn't seen referenced recently, but there's no guarantee when deletion occurs\n\n\n---\n"

Choosing between them affects both functionality and code semantics.\n\nWhen should you use a tuple instead of a list, and what are the semantic implications of this choice?\n\nA) Tuples should always be preferred because they use less memory and are faster; lists are only needed when you specifically require mutation, which is rarely necessary\n\nB) Use tuples for fixed collections that represent a single conceptual item (like coordinates, database records) or when immutability provides safety; use lists for collections that change\n\nC) The choice is purely stylistic; tuples and lists are functionally identical except for syntax, and the decision should be based on team coding style, not technical requirements\n\nD) Tuples are deprecated in Python 3; they're only kept for backward compatibility with Python 2, and all new code should use lists exclusively\n\nE) Use lists for homogeneous data (all same type) and tuples for heterogeneous data (mixed types); this type-based distinction is more important than mutability\n\n\n---\n"
