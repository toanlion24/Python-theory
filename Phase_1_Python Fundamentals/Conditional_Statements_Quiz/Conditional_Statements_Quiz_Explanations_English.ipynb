    "## Question 1: Basic if-else Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer: A) `A`**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple if-else statement. The condition `x > 5` is evaluated first:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "if x > 5:        # 10 > 5 is True\n",
    "    print(\"A\")   # This block executes\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"B\")   # This block is skipped\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- The condition `x > 5` evaluates to `True` because 10 is greater than 5\n",
    "- When the condition is `True`, the code block under `if` executes\n",
    "- The `else` block is skipped when the `if` condition is `True`\n",
    "- Only one of the two blocks (`if` or `else`) executes, never both\n",

    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer: B) `B`**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python evaluates `if-elif-else` statements from top to bottom and executes only the FIRST block whose condition is `True`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "score = 85\n",
    "if score >= 90:      # 85 >= 90 is False, skip\n",
    "    print(\"A\")\n",
    "elif score >= 80:    # 85 >= 80 is True, EXECUTE THIS\n",
    "    print(\"B\")       # Prints \"B\" and stops\n",
    "elif score >= 70:    # Not evaluated (already found a match)\n",
    "    print(\"C\")\n",
    "else:                # Not evaluated (already found a match)\n",
    "    print(\"F\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- Python checks conditions sequentially: `if` first, then `elif` statements in order\n",
    "- Once a condition is `True`, that block executes and Python SKIPS all remaining `elif` and `else` blocks\n",
    "- Even though `score >= 70` is also `True`, it's never checked because the first matching condition (`score >= 80`) already executed\n",
    "- Only ONE block executes, even if multiple conditions are `True`\n",

    "- `a is c`: `True` - `c` references the same object as `a` (same identity)\n",

    "\n",
    "Nested conditionals are conditionals inside other conditionals. Python evaluates the outer condition first, then the inner condition if applicable:\n",

    "    print(\"C\")          # Not reached\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-step:**\n",
    "1. Check outer condition: `x > 10` → `15 > 10` → `True`\n",
    "2. Enter the `if` block\n",
    "3. Check inner condition: `x % 2 == 0` → `15 % 2 == 0` → `0 == 0` → `False`\n",
    "4. Enter the inner `else` block\n",
    "5. Print `\"B\"`\n",
