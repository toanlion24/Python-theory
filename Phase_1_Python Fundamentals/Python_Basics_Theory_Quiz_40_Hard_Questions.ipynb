    "## Question 1: Default Argument Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theory:** Python evaluates default arguments only once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called. For mutable objects like lists or dictionaries, this creates a shared object across all function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does this behavior occur, and what is the fundamental reason Python was designed this way?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Python is trying to optimize memory usage by reusing objects, and default arguments are treated as class variables that persist across calls\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Default arguments are evaluated during function definition, not during function call, which is more efficient but creates shared mutable state when mutable objects are used\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Python treats default arguments as global variables that are created once when the module is loaded, making them accessible to all function instances\n",
    "\n",
    "D) This is a bug in Python's implementation that should be fixed; default arguments should be evaluated fresh each time to prevent this unexpected behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "E) Default arguments are stored as constants in the function's bytecode, and Python reuses constant objects to save memory, which only affects immutable types\n",

    "## Question 2: Mutable vs Immutable Types\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theory:** In Python, some types are mutable (can be changed in-place) while others are immutable (cannot be changed once created). Understanding this distinction is crucial for understanding Python's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which statement accurately describes Python's memory management for mutable vs immutable objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Immutable objects are always stored on the stack, while mutable objects are stored on the heap, which explains why strings cannot be modified but lists can\n",
    "\n",
    "B) All objects in Python are actually mutable; the difference is that \"immutable\" types have methods that return new objects instead of modifying in-place, creating an illusion of immutability\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Immutable objects can be cached and reused (interning), and their identity can be shared, while mutable objects must have unique identities to prevent unintended sharing of modified state\n",
    "\n",
    "D) Python uses copy-on-write for immutable objects, meaning they appear immutable but are actually modified internally; only when you explicitly create a new object does Python allocate new memory\n",
    "\n",
    "E) The mutable/immutable distinction is purely a convention for developers; Python treats all objects the same internally, and the distinction only affects which methods are available\n",

    "## Question 3: String Interning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theory:** Python may intern certain strings, storing them in a special internal cache and reusing the same object for multiple string literals with the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under what conditions does Python reliably intern strings, and why might two strings with identical content not have the same identity?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Python interns all strings automatically to save memory, but only for strings shorter than 20 characters; longer strings are never interned regardless of how they're created\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Python automatically interns all string literals in source code during compilation, but strings created dynamically at runtime (like through concatenation or input) are not interned, even if they match an interned literal\n",
    "\n",
    "C) String interning only occurs for strings that appear more than 3 times in the same module; this optimization was added in Python 3.8 to reduce memory for frequently used strings\n",
    "\n",
    "D) All strings in Python are interned if they contain only ASCII characters; non-ASCII characters prevent interning due to encoding complexities, which is why Unicode strings use more memory\n",
    "\n",
    "E) String interning is never guaranteed in Python; it's an implementation detail that varies between Python versions and should never be relied upon, making `is` comparisons unreliable for strings\n",

    "## Question 4: List vs Tuple Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theory:** Lists and tuples are both sequence types in Python, but lists are mutable while tuples are immutable. This difference affects both functionality and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of memory usage and performance, which statement is most accurate about when to use tuples vs lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Tuples use significantly less memory than lists because they are stored as fixed-size arrays, while lists require extra space for growth; tuples should always be preferred for read-only sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "B) The memory difference between tuples and lists is minimal; tuples are slightly faster for iteration but lists are faster for random access, so the choice should be based on mutability needs rather than performance\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Lists are more memory-efficient than tuples because they use dynamic allocation, while tuples allocate fixed-size blocks that may waste space; lists should be preferred unless immutability is required\n",
    "\n",
    "D) Tuples consume exactly half the memory of lists because they don't store metadata about mutability; this makes tuples the preferred choice for large collections of homogeneous data\n",
    "\n",
    "E) The memory overhead is identical; tuples are just lists with a flag set to prevent modification, so there's no performance benefit to using tuples over lists\n",

    "## Question 5: Dictionary Key Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theory:** Dictionary keys must be hashable, which means they must be immutable types that implement both __hash__() and __eq__() methods consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why must dictionary keys be hashable, and what would happen if mutable types like lists were allowed as keys?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Hashable keys are required for the dictionary's hash table implementation; if lists were keys, changing a list after it's used as a key would break the hash table's lookup mechanism because the hash value would change but the key in the table wouldn't be updated\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Dictionary keys don't actually need to be hashable; this restriction exists only to prevent beginner mistakes, and in future Python versions, all types will be allowed as keys\n",
    "\n",
    "C) The hashable requirement is for security reasons; allowing mutable keys would create vulnerabilities where attackers could modify keys to access unauthorized dictionary entries\n",
    "\n",
    "D) Hashable keys enable faster lookups using hash codes; mutable keys are allowed in some programming languages, but Python's restriction is arbitrary and could be removed without issues\n",
    "\n",
    "E) Keys must be hashable so dictionaries can be serialized to JSON; if lists were keys, JSON serialization would fail because JSON objects require string keys\n",

    "\n",
    "**Theory:** Python follows the LEGB rule for name resolution: Local, Enclosing (nonlocal), Global, and Built-in scopes are searched in that order.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens when you assign a value to a variable inside a function if a variable with the same name exists in the global scope?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) The assignment automatically modifies the global variable; Python always searches global scope first when assigning, so no special keyword is needed to modify globals\n",
    "\n",
    "B) The assignment creates a new local variable that shadows the global variable; to modify the global variable, you must use the `global` keyword before the assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Python raises a SyntaxError because you cannot have local and global variables with the same name; you must rename one to avoid the conflict\n",
    "\n",
    "D) The assignment modifies the global variable if it's mutable (like a list), but creates a local variable if it's immutable (like a string); this behavior depends on the type\n",
    "\n",
    "E) Python uses the value from the nearest scope (local first), but assignment always modifies the global scope regardless of where the assignment occurs\n",

    "\n",
    "What is the order of execution when a `finally` block contains a return statement, and how does it interact with return statements in try/except blocks?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) The finally block executes after try/except, and if finally has a return statement, it completely overrides any return value from try/except blocks, making the earlier return value inaccessible\n",
    "\n",
    "B) The finally block executes, but any return statement in finally is ignored; only the return from try/except blocks matters, and finally just executes cleanup code without affecting return values\n",
    "\n",
    "C) If finally has a return, it executes first before try/except returns, allowing finally to modify the return value by passing it through additional processing before the function actually returns\n",
    "\n",
    "D) Finally blocks with return statements are illegal in Python and raise a SyntaxError; the finally block can only contain cleanup code, not control flow statements like return\n",
    "\n",
    "E) The order depends on the Python version: Python 2 executes finally after return, while Python 3 changed this to execute finally before return, preserving both return values\n",

    "\n",
    "What are the key memory and performance differences between generator expressions and list comprehensions?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Generator expressions use exactly the same amount of memory as list comprehensions because both are evaluated lazily in Python 3; the only difference is syntax preference\n",
    "\n",
    "B) List comprehensions are faster for small datasets but generators are faster for large datasets; however, both consume the same memory, with generators just deferring allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Generator expressions are memory-efficient because they produce values one at a time on-demand, while list comprehensions create the entire list in memory immediately; generators are iterators that don't store all values\n",
    "\n",
    "D) Generators consume more memory because they must store the entire computation state, while list comprehensions just store values; lists are more efficient for memory but slower to create\n",
    "\n",
    "E) The difference is purely conceptual; Python's interpreter converts generator expressions to list comprehensions internally, so there's no actual performance or memory difference\n",

    "\n",
    "**Theory:** Shallow copy creates a new object but doesn't recursively copy nested objects, so nested mutable objects are still shared. Deep copy recursively copies all nested objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "When does a shallow copy behave differently from a deep copy, and what is the underlying mechanism that causes this difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Shallow and deep copies always behave identically; the distinction is only relevant in other programming languages, and Python's copy module treats them the same way\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Shallow copies only differ from deep copies for tuples containing lists; for all other data structures, both copy types produce identical results because Python optimizes copying\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Shallow copy creates a new container object but references to nested objects point to the same memory locations; deep copy recursively creates new objects for all nested structures, preventing shared references\n",
    "\n",
    "D) Shallow copy is faster but only works for flat structures; deep copy is slower but required for nested structures; Python automatically chooses the appropriate method based on data structure depth\n",
    "\n",
    "E) The difference is in how immutable types are handled: shallow copy reuses immutable nested objects (saving memory), while deep copy unnecessarily duplicates immutable objects, wasting memory\n",

    "\n",
    "How does Python ensure set elements are unique, and what happens when you try to add a duplicate element?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Sets maintain a sorted list internally and check for duplicates by comparing each new element with all existing elements; adding duplicates raises a ValueError\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Sets use hash values for quick lookup; when adding an element, Python computes its hash, checks if that hash exists, and if the element equals an existing element with the same hash, it silently ignores the duplicate\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Sets check for duplicates using the `==` operator against all existing elements in order; this O(n) check makes sets slow for large collections but ensures perfect uniqueness\n",
    "\n",
    "D) Uniqueness is enforced by converting all elements to strings and comparing their string representations; this means [1,2] and \"[1,2]\" would be considered duplicates\n",

    "\n",
    "Why are list comprehensions typically faster than equivalent for loops for creating lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) List comprehensions are compiled to optimized bytecode that avoids the overhead of the loop variable and append method calls, executing operations more efficiently in the Python virtual machine\n",

    "B) List comprehensions are faster because they use C extensions under the hood, while for loops execute entirely in Python bytecode, making comprehensions nearly as fast as C code\n",
    "\n",
    "C) The performance difference is a myth; list comprehensions are actually slower because they create a temporary list internally before returning, while loops can modify lists in-place more efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "D) List comprehensions automatically parallelize across multiple CPU cores, while loops run sequentially; this parallelization provides the speed advantage for large datasets\n",
    "\n",

    "How does Python handle type coercion when performing operations between different numeric types?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Python never converts types automatically; operations between different types always raise TypeError; you must explicitly convert types using int(), float(), or str() before operations\n",

    "B) Python follows a hierarchy: complex > float > int; when mixing types, Python automatically converts to the \"higher\" type in this hierarchy to preserve precision and avoid information loss\n",

    "C) Type coercion depends on the operation: addition converts to float, multiplication converts to int, and division always produces float regardless of input types\n",
    "\n",
    "D) Python uses the type of the first operand; if the first operand is int, the result is int; if it's float, the result is float; types are never mixed in calculations\n",

    "\n",
    "What happens when you slice a string with a step value of -1, and how does Python handle the start and stop indices in this case?\n",

    "A) A step of -1 reverses the string, but only if start is 0 and stop is omitted; if start and stop are specified, Python raises ValueError because negative steps require special handling\n",

    "C) Negative step values are not supported for strings; only lists can be sliced with negative steps; strings require using reversed() function instead\n",

    "What happens when you import the same module multiple times, and how does Python handle module caching?\n",

    "## Question 38: Zip Function Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theory:** zip() takes multiple iterables and returns an iterator that aggregates elements from each iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens when zip() receives iterables of different lengths, and how does it handle this situation?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) zip() raises ValueError if iterables have different lengths; all iterables must have the same length, or Python cannot determine how to pair elements\n",
    "\n",
    "B) zip() stops when the shortest iterable is exhausted, producing pairs only up to the length of the shortest input; remaining elements in longer iterables are ignored\n",
    "\n",
    "C) zip() pads shorter iterables with None values to match the longest iterable, ensuring all elements from all inputs are included in the output\n",
    "\n",
    "D) The behavior depends on Python version: Python 2 raises ValueError, but Python 3 automatically pads with None, making version handling important\n",
    "\n",
    "E) zip() creates pairs for all possible combinations when lengths differ; if one iterable has 3 elements and another has 5, zip produces 15 pairs (3×5 Cartesian product)\n",

    "## Question 39: Name Mangling in Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theory:** Python uses name mangling for attributes starting with double underscores (but not ending with them) to provide a weak form of privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is name mangling, and what problem does it solve in Python classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Name mangling makes attributes completely private and inaccessible from outside the class; double-underscore attributes can only be accessed from within the same class definition\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Name mangling rewrites attribute names (__attr becomes _Class__attr) to avoid naming conflicts in inheritance hierarchies; it provides name collision protection, not true privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Name mangling is a syntax error in modern Python; double underscores in attribute names raise SyntaxError because this feature was removed in Python 3.0\n",
    "\n",
    "D) Name mangling only works for method names, not attributes; __method becomes _Class__method, but __attribute remains unchanged and accessible normally\n",
    "\n",
    "E) Python doesn't do name mangling; the double-underscore prefix is just a naming convention that developers use, but Python treats it like any other attribute name\n",

    "## Question 40: List vs Tuple Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theory:** Lists are mutable sequences; tuples are immutable sequences. Choosing between them affects both functionality and code semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "When should you use a tuple instead of a list, and what are the semantic implications of this choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Tuples should always be preferred because they use less memory and are faster; lists are only needed when you specifically require mutation, which is rarely necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Use tuples for fixed collections that represent a single conceptual item (like coordinates, database records) or when immutability provides safety; use lists for collections that change\n",
    "\n",
    "C) The choice is purely stylistic; tuples and lists are functionally identical except for syntax, and the decision should be based on team coding style, not technical requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "D) Tuples are deprecated in Python 3; they're only kept for backward compatibility with Python 2, and all new code should use lists exclusively\n",
    "\n",
    "E) Use lists for homogeneous data (all same type) and tuples for heterogeneous data (mixed types); this type-based distinction is more important than mutability\n",
